-- SQL queries for analysis and integrity checks on AirlineDB

-- 1️ List all flights with total number of passengers per flight segment
SELECT 
    tf.flight_id,
    COUNT(bp.ticket_no) AS total_passengers
FROM 
    ticket_flights tf
JOIN 
    boarding_passes bp ON tf.ticket_no = bp.ticket_no AND tf.flight_id = bp.flight_id
GROUP BY 
    tf.flight_id
ORDER BY 
    total_passengers DESC;

-- 2️ Detect duplicate seat assignments on the same flight (data integrity check)
SELECT 
    flight_id, seat_no,
    COUNT(*) AS occurrences
FROM 
    boarding_passes
GROUP BY 
    flight_id, seat_no
HAVING 
    COUNT(*) > 1;

-- 3️ Find passengers who checked in for flights not included in their ticket (should return 0 rows ideally)
SELECT 
    bp.ticket_no, bp.flight_id
FROM 
    boarding_passes bp
LEFT JOIN 
    ticket_flights tf ON bp.ticket_no = tf.ticket_no AND bp.flight_id = tf.flight_id
WHERE 
    tf.flight_id IS NULL;

-- 4️ Find round-trip tickets (tickets that include at least two opposite flights)
SELECT 
    tf.ticket_no
FROM 
    ticket_flights tf
JOIN 
    flights f1 ON tf.flight_id = f1.flight_id
JOIN 
    flights f2 ON tf.flight_id != f2.flight_id AND tf.ticket_no = tf.ticket_no
    AND f1.arrival_airport = f2.departure_airport AND f1.departure_airport = f2.arrival_airport
GROUP BY 
    tf.ticket_no;

-- 5️ Most frequently used flight routes
SELECT 
    f.departure_airport, f.arrival_airport, COUNT(*) AS flight_count
FROM 
    flights f
GROUP BY 
    f.departure_airport, f.arrival_airport
ORDER BY 
    flight_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 6 Calculate seat utilization per flight (number of boarding passes issued vs aircraft seat count)
SELECT 
    f.flight_id, 
    COUNT(bp.boarding_no) AS occupied_seats,
    a.model,
    s.total_seats
FROM 
    flights f
JOIN 
    boarding_passes bp ON f.flight_id = bp.flight_id
JOIN 
    aircrafts a ON f.aircraft_code = a.aircraft_code
JOIN 
    (
        SELECT aircraft_code, COUNT(*) AS total_seats
        FROM seats
        GROUP BY aircraft_code
    ) s ON a.aircraft_code = s.aircraft_code
GROUP BY 
    f.flight_id, a.model, s.total_seats
ORDER BY 
    occupied_seats DESC;

-- 7 Identify most active customers based on number of tickets booked
SELECT 
    passenger_name, COUNT(DISTINCT ticket_no) AS tickets_booked
FROM 
    tickets
GROUP BY 
    passenger_name
ORDER BY 
    tickets_booked DESC
LIMIT 10;
